教育与职业发展

在大学里，你选择了哪门课程，为什么？

在大学，我主修了计算机科学。实际上，我也不太确定我为什么选择计算机科学。可能是因为windows95吸引了我吧。

你在大学里的竞争力如何？你最喜欢的课程是什么？
在大学我可以很轻松的应对每一门课程，并且有时间去选修其他课程，比如日语。我最喜欢的课程可能是离散数学和线性规划，可能是因为我比较喜欢去挖掘和总结规律性的东西。

Education and career development



1 In college, which course did you choose and why?



In college, I majored in computer science. In fact, I'm not sure why I chose computer science. Maybe Windows 95 attracts me.



How competitive are you in the university? What's your favorite course?

In college, I can easily deal with each course, and have time to take other courses, such as Japanese. My favorite courses may be discrete mathematics and linear programming, perhaps because I prefer to discover and summarize the regular things.




3 Describe your achievements that you are particularly proud of in college or through your career.

I had ever helped Comcast win the 72nd Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for: Large-Scale Deployment of Server-side Ad Manipulation and/or Playout for Adaptive Bitrate Video Distribution, which totally was designed and implemented by my team I was the principle engineer.



Describe your career path and what you hope to achieve in your future career and skill development.



I worked in Motolora for 9 years, focusing on video infrastructure software and applications.

Worked at Comcast for 4 years, devoted to the research and development of video service and advertising system. Worked in China Mobile for 3 years, focusing on the research and development of intelligent media content platform. Now in Huawei, we focus on the research and development of the meta universe media content platform.




Experience and engineering practice



Please describe your level of experience in Python and how you reached this level.

I have been using python since 2010, but I don't use it often. It is only used as a DevOps tool. Later, it was used for the development of AI applications. The use of python mainly depends on the corresponding ecology, such as the ecosystem of scientific computing and the ecosystem of DevOps.



Describe your experience in SQL and relational data modeling, and summarize your learning in large database support applications.

I have used SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL and other databases for applications since 2000. In conclusion, I still agree with the design method of DDD. First design the business domain model, and then design the database according to the domain model, which can well decouple the business model and storage model.



How comprehensive do you think you know about Linux from the kernel? How did you acquire this knowledge?

My work experience does not require me to specifically understand the Linux kernel, so I do not have a very in-depth understanding. I only need to do some in-depth understanding when doing application performance optimization, such as network performance optimization and memory optimization. I need to know network parameters and some memory allocation mechanisms.



How do you systematically solve software performance problems in product and software engineering practices?

Software performance problems can be manifested in CPU, content, IO, network, etc. They may affect each other, and these are related to the design of the software itself, such as data structure design, memory allocation, cache design, etc.



How do you like to promote project documentation?




How do you improve the quality of your work?




Describe an example in which it is very difficult to test the code you write, but you have found a reliable method.





context





How did you participate in open source software?




Why do you want to work for Canonical most?




How does your background and experience fit you for this role in the store team?


Comcast had won the 72nd Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for: 
Large-Scale Deployment of Server-side Ad Manipulation and/or Playout for Adaptive Bitrate Video Distribution.
Actually, this technology was totally designed and implemented by my team.
This technology enabled Comcast to insert advertisements in the cloud or server side for IP Streamed Video 
Content, greatly improving the streaming TV experience for our customers by reducing video buffering caused by advertisements.
