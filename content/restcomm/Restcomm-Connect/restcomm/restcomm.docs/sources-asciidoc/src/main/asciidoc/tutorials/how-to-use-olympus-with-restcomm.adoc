= *Restcomm – How to use Olympus with Restcomm*

Olympus WebRTC client enables fast and convenient set up of Restcomm platform over web interface. With Olympus' WebRTC client, Restcomm has evolved from its previous client, described here http://url[telestax.com/livechat-and-video-call-with-restcomm/].

This tutorial will show you how to use the new Olympus WebRTC client to take advantage of Restcomm’s telephony features.

= Pre-requisites
A Restcomm installation. Please check http://docs.telestax.com/restcomm-docker-quick-start-guide/[http://docs.telestax.com/restcomm-docker-quick-start-guide/] on how to install Restcomm.

= Calling Restcomm with WebRTC

First, let’s see how we can make a call to Restcomm and hear a simple announcement

* Open a browser to http://<restcomm ip>/olympus and Sign in as Alice:

* Olympus will request access to Microphone and Camera and then will present the main screen

* When the main screen is presented:
1. Click on the _Contacts_ icon
1. Click on number _‘1235’_
1. Click _dial_ to make a call to Restcomm and hear the announcement associated with ‘1235’

You could follow these steps to call any Restcomm number by either selecting a number from the list or adding a new one in contacts.
  

== Call from Bob

Say your friend Bob has logged in to Olympus and wants to talk:

*   Use a separate tab to login to Olympus as shown before but this time Sign in as **Bob**, not Alice (for this tutorial we will be using just a separate tab in the same browser, but a more fitting example would be another user from a remote machine)
*   After you sign in as Bob:
1. Click on the Contacts icon 
1. Pick Alice as the desired person to call
1. Click on the video call icon:

At this time, Olympus will start to ring in Alice's window:
