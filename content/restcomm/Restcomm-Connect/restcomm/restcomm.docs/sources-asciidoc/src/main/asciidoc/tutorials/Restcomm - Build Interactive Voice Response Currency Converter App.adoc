[[step-5]]
Step 5
^^^^^^

* Next step is to create the PHP script that is going to work with the application

[source,lang:php,decode:true]
----
<?php
header('Content-Type: application/json');

//amount of USD that need to be converted

$getCurrencyToConvert = $_GET["currency"];
$getCurrencyAmount = $_GET["amount"];

$currencySymbols;
$currencyFullName;

if ($getCurrencyToConvert == 1){
$currencySymbols = "EUR";
$currencyFullName="European Euros";
}elseif($getCurrencyToConvert == 2){
$currencySymbols = "JPY";
$currencyFullName = "Japanese Yen";
}elseif($getCurrencyToConvert == 3){
$currencySymbols = "GBP";
$currencyFullName = "British Pounds Sterling" ;
}elseif($getCurrencyToConvert == 4){
$currencySymbols = "CHF";
$currencyFullName = "Switzerland Francs";
}elseif($getCurrencyToConvert == 5){
$currencySymbols = "ZAR";
$currencyFullName = "South African Rands";
}
//$from - Currency from which we will convert, $to - currency to which we will convert
$from = $currencySymbols;
$to = 'USD';

//Connecting to Yahoo Finance API
$url = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=l1d1t1&s='.$from.$to.'=X';

$handle = fopen($url, 'r');

if ($handle) {
$result = fgetcsv($handle);
fclose($handle);
}

$conversionTotal = $result[0] * $getCurrencyAmount;

$conversionResult = $getCurrencyAmount . " " . $currencyFullName . " converted to US dollars is worth ". $conversionTotal . " dollars as of " . date("F j, Y") . " at ". $result[2];

$result = file_get_contents($url);
$result = json_decode($result);
if ($result->success)
{

}
//parse app days as array
$response = array ('convertedResult' => $conversionResult);

// Output the response as JSON
$json_response = json_encode($response);

//echo $c;
echo $json_response;

?>

[[step-6]]
Step 6
^^^^^^

* Go to *getResults* module
* Add External Service
* Copy and paste the URL to the PHP script that is going to operate with the application
* Add as Url parameters: *getCurrencyAmount* and its value - *$amount* *getCurrencyNumber* and its value - **$currency**
* Assign to getResult, use module as a scope. Add *convertedResult* as value
* Continue to *ResultAudioMessage*
* On Remote Error set Welcome module

[[step-7]]
Step 7
^^^^^^

*  Go to *ResultAudioMessage* module
* Insert Say. Type the following in the text area: "**$getResult**, Thank you for using the Telestax Restcomm currency converter application"

image:./images/resultAudioMessage.jpg[resultAudioMessage,width=559,height=181]

Now add a phone number to the newly created currency converter app using the Restcomm Management Interface. 

You can now dial the number you assigned to the app and follow the IVR instruction to convert any of the listed currency.
