This guide deals with scenarios where Telestax provides you with a Jar file as a patch or as a sponsored feature that requires testing before using in a production environment.

Apply new JAR to an already running container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The steps below will explain how to apply/overide specific jar on a running container. Default jar files are located in the directory below

* /opt/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/lib/

To be able to change Restcomm jars in the WEB-INF/lib/ directory, you must : 

* Mount a host directory as a data volume as explained here(https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/). 

How to update the jar file: 

1.  Login to the server through ssh.
2.  Create a directory /tmp/lib/
3.  Get the Restcomm docker container ID : *sudo docker ps*
4.  Launch an interactive bash shell inside running container (enter to the container running) using:
5.  **sudo docker exec -it container_ID bash**
6.  Go to the directory :  *cd /opt/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/lib/*
7.  copy all jars to the new directory.
8.  *cp * /tmp/lib/*
9.  Type *exit* to get out of the bash container
10. stop the running container: *sudo docker stop Restcomm_Container_ID*
11. Copy the new jar provided by Telestax to the **/tmp/lib**/ directory
12. The above step will replace one of the existing jar files
13. Add the following option to the docker run startup command
14. *-v  /tmp/lib/:/opt/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/lib/*
15. This will override the jars in the *WEB-INF/lib/* with the jars in the */tmp/lib/* directory
16. Start the container for the changes to take effect
17. *sudo docker start Restcomm_container_ID*

This process can be repeated as required.
