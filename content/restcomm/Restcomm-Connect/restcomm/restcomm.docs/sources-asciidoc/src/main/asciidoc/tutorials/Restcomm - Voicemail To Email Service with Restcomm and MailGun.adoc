<?php

//require Composer autoload file
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Mailgun\Mailgun;

//External Service variables needed for the Application Voicemail2Email
$mgKey = $_GET["mgKey"];
$mgDomain = $_GET["mgDomain"];
$emailTo = $_GET["emailTo"];
$emailFrom = $_GET["emailFrom"];
$emailSubject = $_GET["emailSubject"];
$emailBody = $_GET["emailBody"];
$deptOne = $_GET["deptOne"];
$deptTwo = $_GET["deptTwo"];

//Get user's option for which department to leave a message.
$getUserInput = $_GET["getUserInput"];
//Get user phone number
$core_From=$_GET['core_From'];
//Get recording URL
$core_PublicRecordingUrl=$_GET['core_PublicRecordingUrl'];
//Warning message included in the email body
$warning = 'This is an automatic message sent from Smaill Company IVR. Please DO NOT reply to this message.';

//Sending the message to the department of choice
$messageFor;

if ($_GET['getUserInput'] == 1){

$GLOBALS['messageFor'] = $deptOne;

    } elseif($_GET['getUserInput'] == 2){
$GLOBALS['messageFor'] = $deptTwo;
}

//Sending the recording and caller information to specific email
$mgClient = new Mailgun($mgKey);
$result = $mgClient->sendMessage($mgDomain, array(
    'from'    => $emailFrom,
    'to'      => $emailTo,
    'subject' => $GLOBALS['messageFor'] . ':' . $emailSubject,
    'text'    =>   $emailBody . "\r\n" .
            ' Caller info : '. $core_From . "\r\n" .
            ' Click on the voicemail URL: ' .  $core_PublicRecordingUrl  ));



?>
