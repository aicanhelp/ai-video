Restcomm Visual Designer (RVD) is an intuitive web interface designed by Telestax to help developers build  communication applications rapidly. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a voicemail application without writing a single line of programming language code. The voice message can then be emailed to your desired address.

Use case scenarios:

* Voicemail directly to your email,
* Voicemail to a third party (Assistant) for further processing
* Access email where voicemail server is not available.

*Technical Requirements:*

* Basic knowledge of Restcomm
* Basic knowledge of Zapier service (or alternatives web services integration tool such as IfTTT.com)
