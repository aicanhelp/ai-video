=== Sms Attributes

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|==============================================
|Name |Allowed Values |Default Value
|to |phone number |see below
|from |phone number |see below
|action |relative or absolute URL |none
|method |GET, POST |POST
|statusCallback |relative or absolute URL |none
|==============================================

==== to
The 'to' attribute takes a valid E.164 phone number as a value. RestComm will send an SMS message to this number. When sending an SMS during an incoming call, 'to' defaults to the caller. When sending an SMS during an outgoing call, 'to' defaults to the called party. The value of 'to' must be a valid phone number.

==== from
The 'from' attribute takes a valid E.164 phone number as an argument. When sending an SMS during an incoming call, 'from' defaults to the calling party. When sending an SMS during an outgoing call, 'from' defaults to the called party.

==== action
The 'action' attribute takes a URL as an argument. After processing the <Sms> verb, RestComm will make a GET or POST request to this URL with the form parameters 'SmsStatus' and 'SmsSid'. Using an 'action' URL, your application can receive synchronous notification that the message was successfully enqueued. If you provide an 'action' URL, RestComm will use the RCML received in your response to the 'action' URL request to continue the current call. Any RCML verbs occuring after an <Sms> which specifies an 'action' attribute are unreachable. If no 'action' is provided, <Sms> will finish and RestComm will move on to the next RCML verb in the document. If there is no next verb, RestComm will end the phone call.

==== method
The 'method' attribute takes the value 'GET' or 'POST'. This tells RestComm whether to request the 'action' URL via HTTP GET or POST. This attribute is modeled after the HTML form 'method' attribute.

==== statusCallback
The 'statusCallback' attribute takes a URL as an argument. When the SMS message is actually sent, or if sending fails, RestComm will make an asynchronous POST request to this URL with the parameters 'SmsStatus' and 'SmsSid'. Note, 'statusCallback' always uses HTTP POST to request the given url.

===== Request Parameters
