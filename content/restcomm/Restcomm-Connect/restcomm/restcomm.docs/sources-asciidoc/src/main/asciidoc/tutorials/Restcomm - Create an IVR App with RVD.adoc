This tutorial will help you create an Interactive Voice Response application using the Restcomm Visual Designer. It is assumed that you are running Restcomm on a local server. Open your web browser and go the following url.   

NOTE: It is assumed you are running Restcomm on your local installation using the default 127.0.0.1 interface

= Step 1

* go to the link *http://127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-rvd/*
* Enter a name for your new project (Demo1 is used in this tutorial) and press the button *"Create"*

In the main dashboard of the RVD, you will see the default module "Welcome": 

In the Welcome tab

* Change the default text to the following:
* Welcome to Telestax,
* Click the "Collect" verb and drag it onto the module window below the "Say" verb.
* Click and drag another *"Say"* onto the *"Collect"* verb so that it appears below the *"Prompt"*
* In the text area of the new *"Say"* verb, add the following texts:
* For Opening hours press 1, for Technical Support press 2, for Sales Support press 3
* Click on the options button at the bottom of the "Collect" verb window and set *"Number of Digits" to 1*
* The *Number of Digits* tells the media server to process the request after receiving only a single digit.

See screenshot below:

At the top of the page, create a new module by clicking on *"New Module"*

* A new tab called *"Untitled module"* will appear beside the *"Welcome"* tab

* Create a third module and change the name to "Sales Support"

You should now have 4 tabs with the following names

* Opening Hours
* Technical Support
* Sales Support

See the screenshot below

Login and click on the menu "Numbers" 

Click on the button "+Register Number" 

In the "Register Number" window click on "Optional Parameters" to reveal the full options

The Demo1 is the name of the project you created using the RVD 

Leave the rest of the fields as default and press *"Register"* 

If the register is successful, you will see the new number you have just linked to the Demo1 project in the list of numbers as show in the screenshot below:

= Calling and Testing your Demo1

You can now make a SIP call to your application using any SIP phone. In this tutorial, we shall configure Sflphone to connect to Restcomm and make a call to number **4444**. 

Use the following settings to connect your SIP client Sflphone to Restcomm.
