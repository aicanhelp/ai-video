<h1 align="center">TCK Coverage Document for JSR-309</h1>
<h1>TCK Coverage Overview</h1>
<p>The
TCK is composed of a suite of Junit test cases. It leverages Junit for
the test environment, run and reporting. This provides the ability to
run in many environments like eclipse, ant, cactus (see the <a href="../TCKUserGuide.html">TCK User Guide</a>). 
The JSR 309 TCK has been validated on top of the JSR 309 RI in a standalone Java 
environment as well as within a SIP Servlet Application Server Environment, see 
also JSR 309 RI user guide.<br></p>
<h1>Documentation</h1>The documentation of the TCK is composed of:<br><ul><li>the <a href="TCKAssertionsList.html">assertions list</a></li><li>a&nbsp;<a href="../javadoc/TCK/TCKSummary.html">summary of the testcases</a></li><li>a complete <a href="../javadoc/TCK/index.html">javadoc</a></li><li>source code for the test classes, included in the TCK jar. 
	This provides TCK licensee with a clear understanding of how the API is used 
	during the tests.</li><li>a&nbsp;<a href="../TCKUserGuide.html">user guide</a> with instructions for installing and running the TCK, including the signature test and the test appeal process</li><li>the assertions and 
	test cases are cross-referenced:</li><ul><li>when a test case is run, it prints the assertion IDs that it verifies</li><li>in the assertions list table, the 
		test case ID is indicated</li></ul></ul><h1>Coverage</h1>
<ul>
	<li>From the API javadoc, <span style="font-weight: bold;">235 assertions</span> were identified.<ul>
		<li>3&nbsp;other assertions were identified based on good programming practices.</li>
		<li>77 assertions concern optional features, and are thus excluded from the scope 
		of the TCK. </li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">75% mandatory assertions coverage:
		</span>among the 161 mandatory assertions, 121 are tested</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The TCK includes 140 test cases, grouped in 36 Junit test classes that 
	can be run automatically<ul>
		<li>76% of mandatory methods are tested, 64% of all methods are tested 
		(146 methods,&nbsp; corresponding to 122 for mandatory features, 29 are 
		not tested directly, 24 methods correspond to optional features) </li>
		<li>97% of mandatory fields are tested, 24% of all fields are tested 
		(293 fields, corresponding to 73 for mandatory features, 2 are not 
		tested directly, 220 fields correspond to optional features)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>100% API Signature Coverage: for all defined fields and methods for all 
	interfaces and classes are validated<br>
	by the Signature Testing tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult the <a href="methods-coverage">methods coverage</a> and 
<a href="fields-coverage">fields coverage</a>
documents for details. In those documents, the first column has a "M"
or "O" to indicate mandatory / optional items, and the second column has a
"+" or "-" to indicate tested/non-tested items in this version of the TCK.</p>
<p>Refer to documentation of the JSR 309 API overview concerning mandatory / 
optional features. Optional features may not be supported on a specific 
implementation or media server, the API must however be complete and there are 
capabilities built in the API to discover which features are supported. </p>
<h1>TCK Quality and adequacy</h1>
<p>JSR 309 TCK was run on configuration of the JSR 309 Reference Imlpementation 
on Linux and Windows within a standalone Java environment or an Application 
Server environment.</p>
<ul>
	<li>TCK run in standalone mode over the Reference Implementation: <a href="TCK-report-standalone.html">
	TCK-report-standalone</a>.</li>
	<li>TCK run in App Server mode over the Reference Implementation: <a href="TCK-report-appserver.html">
	TCK-report-appserver</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code quality was demonstrated through use of code reviews. User&#39;s Guide was 
constructed from sections of the TCK User&#39;s Guide template. The TCK has been 
reviewed and tested by several members of the HP &amp; Oracle Spec Lead team and 
some of the JSR 309 expert group members.</p>
<p>As the first major release of this new Media Server Control 1.0 specification 
, the coverage is good and consistent with the coverage of similar JSRs at this 
level of spec maturity. Coverage variance is due to effects of late spec changes 
and the availability/cost of test development resources. Emphasis was given to 
covering critical spec areas as identified by the<br>
Spec Lead and Expert Group, especially for applications use cases covering audio 
IVR and Conferencing. The coverage can be increased during the next major 
specification update.</p>
