/**
 * An Endpoint is a logical representation of a physical entity, such as an analog phone or a channel in a trunk.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Endpoints are sources or sinks of data and can be physical or virtual. Physical endpoint creation requires hardware
 * installation while software is sufficient for creating a virtual Endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An interface on a gateway that terminates a trunk connected to a PSTN switch is an example of a physical Endpoint. An audio
 * source in an audio-content server is an example of a virtual Endpoint.
